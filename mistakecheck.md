Sure! Here’s a **line-by-line** explanation of the JavaScript function that highlights **correct** letters in **blue** and **incorrect** ones in **red**.

---

### **JavaScript Code with Detailed Explanation**
```js
const randomTextElement = document.getElementById("randomText");
const inputTextElement = document.getElementById("inputText");
```
- **`document.getElementById("randomText")`** → Selects the paragraph (`<p>`) where the random text is displayed.
- **`document.getElementById("inputText")`** → Selects the input field where the user types.

---

```js
const originalText = randomTextElement.innerText; // Store the original text
```
- Stores the **original random text** that was generated so that we can compare it with user input later.

---

```js
inputTextElement.addEventListener("input", () => {
```
- **`addEventListener("input", () => {`** → This listens for any keystrokes in the input field. Whenever the user types something, the function will run.

---

```js
    const userInput = inputTextElement.value;
```
- Gets the **current text** that the user has typed in the input box.

---

```js
    let highlightedText = "";
    let mistakeMade = false;
```
- **`highlightedText`** → This will store the modified version of the original text with colored letters.
- **`mistakeMade`** → A flag to track **if the user has made a mistake**. If `true`, all remaining letters will be colored red.

---

```js
    for (let i = 0; i < originalText.length; i++) {
```
- A **loop** that goes through each letter of the `originalText` one by one.

---

```js
        if (i < userInput.length) {
```
- **Checks if the user has typed this character already.**  
- If `i` is less than the length of `userInput`, it means the user has entered a character at this position.

---

```js
            if (!mistakeMade && userInput[i] === originalText[i]) {
```
- **Checks if the user’s input at position `i` matches the original text.**  
- **`!mistakeMade`** → Ensures that we are still in "correct mode" (haven’t found a mistake yet).  
- **`userInput[i] === originalText[i]`** → Compares the user’s typed character with the corresponding character in `originalText`.

---

```js
                highlightedText += `<span style="color: blue;">${originalText[i]}</span>`;
```
- If the character **matches**, it is wrapped inside a `<span>` tag with **blue color** and added to `highlightedText`.

---

```js
            } else {
                mistakeMade = true;
                highlightedText += `<span style="color: red;">${originalText[i]}</span>`;
            }
```
- **If the character doesn't match:**
  - Sets `mistakeMade = true` (meaning the user has made a mistake).
  - **Colors the current character and all following characters in red.**

---

```js
        } else {
            highlightedText += originalText[i]; // Default text color for untyped characters
        }
```
- **If the user hasn’t typed this character yet**, it remains in its default color.

---

```js
    randomTextElement.innerHTML = highlightedText; // Update the displayed text
});
```
- **Updates the displayed text** inside `randomTextElement` with the modified, color-highlighted version.

---

### **How the Code Works in Practice**
1. **User starts typing** in the input field.
2. **The script compares** the input character-by-character with the original text.
3. **If a character is correct**, it turns **blue**.
4. **If a mistake is made**, the wrong letter **and all following letters** turn **red**.
5. **The display updates instantly** after every keystroke.

### **Example Output**
#### **Original Text**
```
hello world
```

#### **User Types:** `hel`  
**Output:**  
✅ `hel` → **(blue, correct)**  
⬜ `lo world` → **(default, untyped)**  

---

#### **User Types:** `helo`  
**Output:**  
✅ `hel` → **(blue, correct)**  
❌ `o` → **(red, wrong)**  
❌ ` world` → **(red, after mistake)**
